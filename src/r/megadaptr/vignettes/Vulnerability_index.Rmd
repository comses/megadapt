# Vulnerability index 

The vulnerability of a census block is calculated using the “surface of vulnerability” definition by (Luers 2005). In this framework, the vulnerability index is summarized as the ratio between the product of exposure $E$ and sensitivity $S$, and the adaptive capacity of the census block. Formally:

$$V_{jt}^Η=\frac{E_{jt}^Η*S_{jt}^Η}{\tau_{jt}}$$ 
where $V_{nt}$ is the vulnerability in census block $j$ at time $t$. $E_{jt}^Η$ is the exposure, defined as the flooding or scarcity index. $S_{jt}^Η$ represents the sensitivity of census block $j$ to hazard events $Η$. We measure this by keeping track of the number of decisions that involve house modifications. The more these actions accumulate in a census block, the less sensitive the residents would be. $\tau_{jt}$ represents the adaptive capacity of the census block. We assume that 
$$\tau_{jt}=(1+Ι_{jt}),$$ 
where $Ι_{jt}$ is the income index of census block $j$. Thus, we explicitly assumed that census blocks with more resources have higher adaptive capacity than poor census blocks. That is, wealthy areas are less vulnerable because they have more access to resources to take action. 

# Sensitivity 

The action “House modification” influences the sensitivity of the residents to hazard events. We define the sensitivity of the house as a change of the perception of the magnitude of a hazard. Formally, we assume that sensitivity $S_{jt}^Η$ is defined by:

$$S_{jt}^{Η} = 1- \frac{Y_{jt}^{k}}{Y_{jt}^{k}+\eta}$$

where 
$$Y_{jt}^{k}=\sum_{t=1}^t{y_{jt}^{k}}$$ 
is the accumulated number of times that the action “house modification” ($y_{jt}^{k}=1$) was invoked by the residents of census block $j$. This formalization assumes therefore that modifications are cumulative and the change in the sensitivity of the residents depends on the rate of adaptation, $\eta$.
